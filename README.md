Challenge 19 PWA

## Description
This is a progressive web application that alllows the user to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection and where the user can reliably retrieve them for later use. The integrated service worker and Cache API's ensure that the application will remain fully functional even without and active internet connection. The user may return to the notes later even if there is no internet connection

##Motivation and Use
I was motivated to build this project because I wanted to create a note taking app that would work online and offline and save my work while giving others an alternative to traditional note taking apps. This app is easily to download on desktop or mobile and taught me a great deal about progressive web applications, service workers and webpack.I believe that the app could be very useful for students who want to create code or take notes online and have those notes be available to them offline.
